## Codebase Patterns
- Xcode project structure: Browseroo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj contains build configuration, Browseroo/ contains source files
- SwiftUI app uses @main attribute on App struct with Scene body
- Info.plist with LSUIElement=true makes app a menu bar agent (no Dock icon)
- Deployment target set in project.pbxproj under MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
- xcodebuild requires Xcode.app to be installed (Command Line Tools not sufficient)
- MenuBarExtra(title, systemImage:) is used for the menu bar dropdown (macOS 13.0+)

## 2026-01-28 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created Xcode project named Browseroo with SwiftUI lifecycle
  - Set LSUIElement to true in Info.plist (no Dock icon)
  - Set minimum deployment target to macOS 13.0
  - Created app entitlements, asset catalogs, and basic SwiftUI app structure
- Files changed:
  - Browseroo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new)
  - Browseroo/BrowserooApp.swift (new)
  - Browseroo/ContentView.swift (new)
  - Browseroo/Info.plist (new)
  - Browseroo/Browseroo.entitlements (new)
  - Browseroo/Assets.xcassets/* (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - xcodebuild requires full Xcode.app installation, not just Command Line Tools
  - Use `swiftc -parse` to verify Swift syntax when xcodebuild unavailable
  - LSUIElement in Info.plist controls whether app appears in Dock
  - Deployment target is set in both Debug and Release configurations in project.pbxproj

## 2026-01-28 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Replaced WindowGroup with MenuBarExtra in BrowserooApp
  - App now displays a globe icon in the macOS menu bar
  - Clicking the icon opens a dropdown menu with placeholder text "Browseroo"
  - Combined with LSUIElement=true, app does not appear in Dock
- Files changed:
  - Browseroo/BrowserooApp.swift (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MenuBarExtra is the SwiftUI way to create menu bar apps (available macOS 13.0+)
  - MenuBarExtra takes a title (for accessibility), systemImage (SF Symbol name), and content closure
  - ContentView.swift is no longer used for menu bar apps but can be kept for potential window scenes
