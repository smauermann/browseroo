# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Xcode project structure: Browseroo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj contains build configuration, Browseroo/ contains source files
- SwiftUI app uses @main attribute on App struct with Scene body
- Info.plist with LSUIElement=true makes app a menu bar agent (no Dock icon)
- Deployment target set in project.pbxproj under MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
- xcodebuild requires Xcode.app to be installed (Command Line Tools not sufficient)

## 2026-01-28 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created Xcode project named Browseroo with SwiftUI lifecycle
  - Set LSUIElement to true in Info.plist (no Dock icon)
  - Set minimum deployment target to macOS 13.0
  - Created app entitlements, asset catalogs, and basic SwiftUI app structure
- Files changed:
  - Browseroo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new)
  - Browseroo/BrowserooApp.swift (new)
  - Browseroo/ContentView.swift (new)
  - Browseroo/Info.plist (new)
  - Browseroo/Browseroo.entitlements (new)
  - Browseroo/Assets.xcassets/* (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - xcodebuild requires full Xcode.app installation, not just Command Line Tools
  - Use `swiftc -parse` to verify Swift syntax when xcodebuild unavailable
  - LSUIElement in Info.plist controls whether app appears in Dock
  - Deployment target is set in both Debug and Release configurations in project.pbxproj
